# ANN-for-PV-Output-Power-Prediction
Design an ANN model to predict the future output power of a PV(Photovoltaic) power plant.

The main aim is to use the historical data collected from a PV power plant for predicting the future output power values, preferably for next 24 or 48 hours.

The historical data collected from the power plant contains the output power values and the data of some weather parameters measured at the site of the power plant. An ANN(Artificial Neural Network) model should be designed which takes the weather parameters as the input and predicts the PV output power. 

The historical weather parameters considered/collected for the project are: Wind speed, Air temperature and Solar Radiation(GHI).
